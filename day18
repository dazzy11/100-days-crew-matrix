You are given positive integers n and m.
Define two integers, num1 and num2, as follows:
num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] that are not divisible by m.
num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] that are divisible by m.
Return the integer num1 - num2.
Example 1:
Input: n = 10, m = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are not divisible by 3 are [1,2,4,5,7,8,10], num1 is the sum of those integers = 37.
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3 are [3,6,9], num2 is the sum of those integers = 18.
We return 37 - 18 = 19 as the answer.
  class Solution {
    public int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int num1=0,num2=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            if(i%m==0){
                num1=num1+i;
            }
            else{
                num2=num2+i;
            }
        }
        return num2-num1;
    }
}
