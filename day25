You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. Your task is to perform the following operation exactly k times in order to maximize your score:
Select an element m from nums.
Remove the selected element m from the array.
Add a new element with a value of m + 1 to the array.
Increase your score by m.
Return the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation exactly k times.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: 18
  class Solution {
    public int maximizeSum(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
            sum=nums[nums.length-1]+sum;
            nums[nums.length-1]=nums[nums.length-1]+1;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
