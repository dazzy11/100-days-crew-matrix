Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.
  class Solution {
    public int findClosestNumber(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int mincount=Integer.MAX_VALUE,count=0,ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            count=Math.abs(nums[i]);
            if(count<mincount){
                mincount=count;
                ans=nums[i];
            }
            if(count==mincount){
                ans=nums[i];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
